# PassLock
#### Vault that stores passwords to accounts and generates passwords for new accounts
#### By **Victor Maina**
## Description
PassLock is a simple Python app that stores users' passwords. Using the CLI, a user can create a new account to store passwords to existing accounts. They can also create new accounts, and choose whether to generate a new password or not. The user navigated the app using number codes, an idea inpired by mobile USSD technology.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To use the app, you need to run it locally on a terminal. Use Git to clone this repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/VictorKMaina/password-vault.git
```

The app requires Python to run. To install Python on Ubuntu, do this:
```
$ sudo apt install python3.9
```

Once this is done, navigate in the `password-vault` directory and run the app.
```
$ ./run.py
```

## Creating an account
Upon running the app, this is what you will see:
```
Welcome to PassLocker.

1. Create New Account
2. Log In
3. Show existing users
4. Exit PassLocker

Choose an option:
```

To create a new account, enter `1`.

## Known Bugs
There are a few issues with mobile responsiveness in the app. On some devices, the input form won't show.
